## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added `DomainNameItem` and `DomainNameConfig` for domain name input validation.
  Provides built-in validation according to RFC standards including label length
  limits, allowed characters, and overall domain name structure validation.

### Changed

- Refined layout and validation styling in `user_input_composite`,
  `user_input_comparison`, `user_input_select`, `user_input` and
  `vec_searchable` modules to align with updated design standards.

## [0.11.0] - 2025-06-25

### Changed

- Changed `PortRange` struct fields from `Option<i64>` to `Option<u16>` for
  improved type safety and accuracy, as port numbers range from 0 to 65535.
- Replaced `pumpkin-dark` and `pumpkin-light` features with a single
  `pumpkin` feature for unified theme handling.
- Updated to Rust 2024 edition.
- Add height to `Modal` and support HTML in `TextStyle`.
- Add `MsgType::None` for modal and set title header when not pumpkin.
- Added an `immutable` flag to `TextConfig` â€” when true, disables the associated
  input field in the edit modal.
- Adjusted `notification` z-index from 99999 to 90 to ensure better layering and
  compatibility with other UI components.
- Added `overflow-y: auto` to `input-inner` to enhance vertical scrolling and
  layout behavior.
- Added `UInteger`, `Vector`, `IpAddr`, `Bool` to `ValueKind`.
- `creation_time` in `ListItem` no longer uses `DateTime<Utc>` from `chrono`; it
  now uses `Timestamp` from `jiff`.

### Fixed

- Fixed overflow error when `NotificationType::ErrorList` has an empty errors.
- Fixed notifications not re-rendering when a new notification is given without

- Introduced `{CheckboxColumn | RadioColumn}::modal`, which displays a modal
  window corresponding to each of the `{CheckboxColumn | RadioColumn}::display`
  elements.
- The content of both `modal` and `display` is directly injected into the HTML
  stream using `Html::from_html_unchecked` from Yew.
